# Bank App

This project is a front-end banking application designed to provide users with a seamless interface for managing their finances. It includes key banking features such as viewing account balances, transferring money, and tracking transactions, all in a modern, responsive interface.

## Features

### 1. Account Overview
The app provides users with a comprehensive view of their accounts, including checking, savings, and credit card balances. Users can quickly glance at their current financial status and navigate to individual accounts for more detailed information.

### 2. Transaction History
Each account includes a detailed transaction history, allowing users to view past transactions, filter by date or type (debit/credit), and download statements. This feature makes it easy to track spending, manage budgets, and stay on top of finances.

### 3. Fund Transfers
The app includes an easy-to-use fund transfer feature, allowing users to move money between their own accounts or send money to other recipients. The transfer interface is intuitive, with options for one-time transfers or setting up recurring payments.

### 4. Bill Payments
Users can manage bill payments directly through the app, adding payees and scheduling payments. This feature streamlines the process of handling regular bills, providing reminders for upcoming payments and a history of past payments.

### 5. Responsive Design
The application is built to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience whether accessed on desktop or mobile devices. The layout adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability and functionality.

### 6. Secure Authentication
The app includes a secure login system with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. Users are required to enter a code sent via SMS or email to verify their identity during the login process.

### 7. Budgeting Tools
The app offers basic budgeting tools, allowing users to set monthly budgets, categorize their spending, and receive alerts if they are approaching their budget limits. This feature helps users stay in control of their financial goals.
